## 🧹 Step 4: Unpin to update priorities

Sometimes priorities change — that's where unpinning comes in.

In this step, you'll **unpin a Discussion** to reflect updated priorities or remove outdated announcements.

### 📌 Why this matters
Unpinning Discussions helps keep your repository organized and focused. It ensures only the most relevant topics remain visible to your community.

### ⌨️ Activity: Unpin your Discussion
1. Go to the **Discussions** tab.
2. Look for a Discussion that has already been pinned (you'll see a 📌 icon).
3. Scroll to the **bottom of the pinned Discussion**.
4. Click **Unpin this Discussion**.
5. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) to automatically update to the next step.
