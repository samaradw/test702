## Step 2: Pin a Discussion 

Now that you've started a Discussion, let‚Äôs make sure it gets the visibility it deserves. Start this step by pinning your Discussion so your community can quickly see the most important threads. 

### ü§î Why this matters

Pinned Discussions stay at the top of your list and help everyone find key questions, announcements, or updates quickly. Use pinning to highlight critical information for your team or contributors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Activity: Pin your Discussion

1. Go to your Discussions tab.
2. Click into the Discussion you just created.
3. In the top right panel, look for the **Pin Discussion to‚Ä¶** option.
4. Click it. If successful, your Discussion will now show a üìå **Pinned** label.
5. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) to automatically update to the next step.
